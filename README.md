# REWEIGHTED PROBABILISTIC MODELS

Reference implementation of 
*Robust Probabilistic Modeling with Bayesian Data Reweighting.*
[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03860)]


This folder contains code to replicate:

+ empirical study on a Poisson model with corrupted observations

+ empirical study on a Generalized Linear model with missing latent groups. The code illustrates the use of Dirichlet prior on weights in the example. 

+ empirical study on a Gaussian Mixture model with skewed distributions
