# REWEIGHTED PROBABILISTIC MODELS

Reference implementation of Reweighted Probabilistic Models 


This folder contains code to replicate:

**Figure 2a:** empirical study on a Poisson model with corrupted observations

**Figure 3b:** empirical study on a Generalized Linear model with missing latent groups. The code illustrates the use of Dirichlet prior on weights in the example. It produces a similar figure to Figure 3b (beta prior).

**Figure 4:** empirical study on a Gaussian Mixture model with skewed distributions
